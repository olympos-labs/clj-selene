# Contributing to Selene

Hi there, thanks for stopping by!

## Issues

This library is designed to compute lunar cycles and moon phases for Clojure and
ClojureScript, with as few external dependencies as possible. Please do not
request features to this library that go outside the desired design.

In particular, do not request this library to be ported to JavaScript or to add
support for other astronomical computations (e.g. sunrise/sunset,
moonrise/moonset or tides). However, you are very welcome to fork the library
and add support for that in your own fork!

## Pull Requests

Selene is a solo project I'm doing for fun, and I'm not looking for new features
from others. Please refrain from making any PRs without a corresponding issue
where I approve of such changes. If there is an obvious or small bug, you may
make a PR to fix it. For bigger changes, I'd like an issue first so that you
don't waste your time.
